(1999)</a>, and updated online in 2004 (see data source for link).  Such ratios reflect both the local temperature at the site of deposition and global changes associated with the extent of permanent continental glaciation. As such, relative changes in oxygen isotope ratios can be interpreted as rough changes in climate.  <br/> <br/>Quantitative conversion between this data and direct temperature changes is a complicated process subject to many systematic uncertainties, however it is estimated that each 1 part per thousand change in δ18O represents roughly a 1.5-2 °C change in tropical sea surface temperatures (<a href='http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v408/n6813/full/408698a0.html'> Veizer et al. 2000 </a>). On geologic time scales, the largest shift in oxygen isotope ratios is due to the slow radiogenic evolution of the mantle.</p>"]

This is called the 'Alternation of Generations'. During their evolution, terrestrial plants have gradually changed from haploid (gametophyte) dominance to diploid (sporophyte) dominance.  This influences the genetic structure of different  plant groups and thus the environments they can colonise. <br/><br/> Find out more: <br/> <a target='_blank' href='http://hypnea.botany.uwc.ac.za/phylogeny/bioCycles/sporic.htm'> Sporic Life Cycles </a> </p> "]

This is closely linked with plate tectonics and climate.  A decrease in sealevel would increase the coastal peripheral area, creating more shallow semi-aquatic habitats in which primitive land plants are thought to have emerged.
