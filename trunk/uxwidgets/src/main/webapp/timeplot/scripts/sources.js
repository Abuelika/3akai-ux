Multicellularity has evolved several times (see image below right), so that different organisms (such as plants and animals) have different strategies for achieving multicellularity (i.e. they have different life cycles).  <br/><br/> The strategy used by plants involves two phases: a haploid and a diploid stage.  All terrestrial plants show show this strategy, but vary in the length of life spent in the haploid and diploid states, and also in the independence or interdependence of the two phases.  The cycle between haploid and diploid phases is is called the 'Alternation of Generations'.  During their evolution, terrestrial plants have gradually changed from haploid (gametophyte) dominance to diploid (sporophyte) dominance.  More primitive plants have a more dominant haploid phase, whereas plants that evolved much later (such as the angiosperms) have a dominant diploid phase.  This influences the genetic structure of different plant groups and thus the environments they can colonise. <br/><br/> Find out more: <br/> <a target='_blank' href='http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v409/n6823/full/4091102a0.html'> Multicellularity </a> <br/> <a target='_blank' href='http://hypnea.botany.uwc.ac.za/phylogeny/bioCycles/sporic.htm'> Sporic Life Cycles </a> </p><img src='../images/diploidhaploid.jpg' style='width: 290px; float: left;'/><a target='_blank' href='http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v409/n6823/images/4091102ab.2.jpg'><img src='http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v409/n6823/images/4091102ab.2.jpg' style='width: 340px; float: right;'/></a> "]
