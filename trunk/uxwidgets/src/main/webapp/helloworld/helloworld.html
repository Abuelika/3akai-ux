<!-- 
This is the main container of where all of the DOM elements owned by this widget will be in. There is no need for a single all-containing container, but it does make it easier to control the appearance of your widget.
-->
<div id="mainHelloContainer" style="display:none">
	<!-- 
	This p tag will be shown on the screen. The helloworld_username span is a placeholder which will be used to pull in and display the username of the current user.
	-->
	<p>Hello World, <span id="helloworld_username"></span></p>
</div>

<!--
This is the container where everyhting within the settings mode of the widget will live, like widget personalisation, ... Mind that we explicitely put style="display:none" in both of the containers. We do this because if we put this inside a CSS file, there is a risk of showing the containers for a short time while the CSS file is being loaded.
-->
<div id="settingsHelloContainer" style="display:none">
	<!-- 
	This settings view will show an extremely basic No Settings available text
	-->
	<p>No settings available</p>
</div>


<!-- 
This is the javascript file that will take care of all of the interactions for this widget. Mind that we put the file at the bottom of the widget, because our javascript code will require all of the DOM elements to be available.
-->
<script type="text/javascript" language="JavaScript" src="/devwidgets/helloworld/javascript/helloworld.js"></script>
