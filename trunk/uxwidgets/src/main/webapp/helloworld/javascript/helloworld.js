This is the constructor of your widget which basically gives you a place where the widget code can play in. This is the function that will be executed by the portal container and from there on everything is up to your code. The things that come in to this constructor are
	- tuid: The unique id of the div your widget is being placed. In all of the selectors you use, you should limit the DOM search to that div.
	- placement: This is basically the URL (site/page/dashboard) of where your widget is being placed. This will give you a URL structure to which you can save preferences for this particular widget in that particular context
	- showSettings: this is a true/false value which will tell whether we want the edit mode or the view mode. The decision of which one is required is up to the portal container.
