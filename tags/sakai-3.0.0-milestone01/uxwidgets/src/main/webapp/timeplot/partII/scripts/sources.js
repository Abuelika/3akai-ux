This figure shows the long-term evolution of oxygen isotope ratios during the Phanerozoic eon as measured in fossils, reported by <a href='http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6V5Y-3XNK494-5&_user=1495569&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=1495569&md5=df70b79b9fdad5a102f167bbb5cae568' target='_blank' > Veizer et al. (1999)</a>, and updated online in 2004 (see data source for link).  Such ratios reflect both the local temperature at the site of deposition and global changes associated with the extent of permanent continental glaciation. As such, relative changes in oxygen isotope ratios can be interpreted as rough changes in climate.  
<br/><br/>
Quantitative conversion between this data and direct temperature changes is a complicated process subject to many systematic uncertainties, however it is estimated that each 1 part per thousand change in &#x3b4;<sup>18</sup>O represents roughly a 1.5-2&deg;C change in tropical sea surface temperatures (<a href='http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v408/n6813/full/408698a0.html'> Veizer et al. 2000 </a>). On geologic time scales, the largest shift in oxygen isotope ratios is due to the slow radiogenic evolution of the mantle.  This can be investigated using the 'Tectonic Activity' data provided in this timeplot tool.

Paeofloras were dominated by Pteridophyte species during much of the early Paleaozoic.  These floras were replaced by ones dominated by gymnosperm species during the Mesozoic.  The most recent floras are dominated by angiosperm species.  The trend of increasing species number throughout the history of the vascular plants is the result of a slight surplus of species accumulated over hundreds of millions of years.

<br/> <br/> 
The life cycle of an organism enables mulitcellularity. Multicellularity has evolved several times (see image below right), so that different organisms (such as plants and animals) have different strategies for achieving multicellularity (i.e. they have different life cycles).  
<br/><br/> 
The strategy used by plants involves two phases: a haploid and a diploid stage.  All terrestrial plants show show this strategy, but vary in the length of life spent in the haploid and diploid states, and also in the independence or interdependence of the two phases.  The cycle between haploid and diploid phases is is called the 'Alternation of Generations'.  During their evolution, terrestrial plants have gradually changed from haploid (gametophyte) dominance to diploid (sporophyte) dominance.  More primitive plants have a more dominant haploid phase, whereas plants that evolved much later (such as the angiosperms) have a dominant diploid phase.  This influences the genetic structure of different plant groups and thus the environments they can colonise.

Lecture Summary: 
<br/> <br/> 
* Colonisation of land requires the avoidance of desiccation. <br/> * Impermeable cuticles require stomata. <br/> * Transport systems for water plus nutrients and for photosynthates are essential for large plants. <br/> * Lignin is an extraordinary polymer necessary for tree development and the 3-D world. <br/> * Without fungal mutualism, plant (and hence animal) evolution on land would have been very different.

Part IA: Angiosperm Radiation: Lecture 1</a> 
<br/> <br/> 
Several authors have hypothesised that the origin of angiosperms, and the tempo and pattern of their subsequent radiation, was mediated by changes in the browsing behaviour of large herbivorous dinosaurs (tetrapods). <br/><br/>A paper by Barrett and Willis (<a href='http://journals.cambridge.org/production/action/cjoGetFulltext?fulltextid=83876' target='_blank' > Barrett PM and Willis KJ (2001) Did dinosaurs invent flowers? Biol. Rev. Camb. Philos. Soc. 76,3, 411-447</a>) reviews the evidence for dinosaur/angiosperm interactions during the Cretaceous Period.<br/><br/> According to the authors, it is likely that other animal groups (insects, some mammals) had a greater impact on angiosperm diversity during the Cretaceous than herbivorous dinosaurs. Elevated levels of atmospheric CO2 might also have played a critical role in the initial stages of the angiosperm radiation. You may like to consider this using the available 'CO2' and 'Insect' data on this time plot tool.

Part IA: Angiosperm Radiation: Lecture 1</a> 
<br/> <br/> 
This shows the first appearances of some of the major groups of animals and plants.  It highlights how late the Angiosperms arise in the geological record.  
<br/><br/>
The Angiosperms first appear in the fossil record in the Early Cretaceous period, about 130 million years ago, and then radiate very quickly over the next 40 million years to give the huge diversity we see today.  Darwin described the speed of Angiosperm radiation as 'an abominable mystery'. 
<br/><br/>
Using the 'Tetrapod', 'Insect', and 'CO2' data, you can begin to assess why Angiosperms appeared so late and what might have caused their rapid radiation.

Rubisco is the most fundamental protein on earth, and weÕll see how crystalline structure and catalytic functioncan be related to both molecular sequence (rbcLphylogeny) and contrasting kinetic characteristicsbetween phylogenetic groups. You need to understand how kinetic properties of Rubisco differ between contrasting evolutionary groups, and how this affects relative carboxylase:oxygenaseactivities (vc/vo) in relation to CO2/O2supply.Additionally, you will be able to calculate vc/vo for a given temperature, and stomatal aperture, and realise that internal airspaces maximise delivery of CO2in  modern, low CO2world. Meantime, consider what the implications would have been for early land plants, which as we will see in the next lecture (after the break), had minimal stomata and internal airspaces.
